My Minimal React Webpack Babel Setup
- redo config stuff. hotloading/loaders are funny, try just babel loader, see if preset stage-2 is working
- if i import a css file will it bundle it for me? import './styles/styles.css';
- maybe page to create lists
- maybe page for creating accounts
- maybe make these pages empty so I can do routing

-create categories ie fruit/meat/dairy etc and have app remember settings to autocomplete
- be able to enter a recipe and auto load groceries
- oauth
- how about the login that can text code to phone?
